      <h2>Some stuff about leap b4 u look</h2>
      <p>So leap b4 u look is a little project for me right now. However, I'm still in school, so I dont have a lot of free time, but hopefully soon I'll be able to start making some Indie Electronica, Lo-fi jazz, reggae, heck maybe even some alternative or indie rock. Below are some types of music that I enjoy and would maybe like to make in the future. I'm a pretty chill dude but I get a lot of energy when I'm around people, (I'm social), but yeah I like chill music and hopefully I'll be able to give you guys some of that stuff when I get the chance. Like I said though, school is a pain and it takes up most of my waking moments. (DISCLAIMER: I did not make any of this music. These songs are merely examples of types of music I would like to produce some time in the near future.)</p>
