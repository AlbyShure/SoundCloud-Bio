      <h2>About the project</h2>
      <p>So leap b4 u look is a little project for me right now. However, I'm still in school, so I dont have a lot of free time, but hopefully soon I'll be able to start making some Indie Electronica, Lo-fi jazz, reggae, heck maybe even some alternative or indie rock. This website is for you guys to enjoy some of my personal picks. Below are some types of music that I enjoy and would maybe like to make in the future. I'm a pretty chill dude but I get a lot of energy when I'm around people, (I'm social), but yeah I like chill music and hopefully I'll be able to give you guys some of that stuff when I get the chance. Like I said though, school is a pain and it takes up most of my waking moments. (DISCLAIMER: I did not make any of these songs. All rights to their respective owners. These songs are merely examples of types of music I would like to produce some time in the near future.)</p>
      <h2>About moi</h2>
      <p>I was born in Boston, which is irrelevant to the fact that I (obviously) love music. I've been playing acoustic guitar for almost four years now and electric for about 2. For acoustic, I enjoy playing all types of music, from alternative rock to indie pop. On electric, I enjoy playing jazz and rock. I find heavy metal astoundingly fun to play but I don't really like to listen to it. My musical taste is (not to boast) extremely diverse, and possibly even at times ecclectic. If there is a genre of music out there I have not listened to, I will not hesitate to try it. If you have any that you'd like me to try, my email is allanh03@yahoo.com. Thats about it for basic info, so I'll let you enjoy this music. Thanks.
