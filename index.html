      <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
      <p>So this is a little project for me right now. I'm still in school, so I dont have a lot of free time, but hopefully soon I'll be able to start making some Indie Electronica, Lo-fi jazz, reggae, heck maybe even some alternative rock. I'm a pretty chill dude but I get a lot of energy when I'm around people, (I'm social), but yeah I like chill music and hopefully I'll be able to give you guys some of that stuff when I get the chance.</p>
